## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Are there things we're better off not knowing? Join us for a relaxed, interactive session where we'll explore this thought-provoking question together. We'll look at real-life examples, from historical events to modern issues like AI and genetic engineering. No heavy theories here—just practical discussions and real-world perspectives. Come share your thoughts and be part of the conversation!


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Catarina.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
