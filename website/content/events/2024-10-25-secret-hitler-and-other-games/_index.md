## Preparation

None.


## What will we do?

Play boardgames! I will bring two social deduction games suitable for large
groups namely "Secret Hitler" and "Der Tempel des Schreckens" (despite being a
German title it can be played in any language) and if you want you can bring
ONE game of your choice (to make selection easier).


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
