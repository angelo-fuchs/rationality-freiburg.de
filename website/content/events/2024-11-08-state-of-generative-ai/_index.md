## Preparation

None, bring a laptop if possible.

## What will we do?

This event will be a mix of presentation and workshop.
I will try to guide you through the landscape of generative AI as best as possible.
We will cover current text, image, audio and video generation models and tools from a practical perspective.
We will not touch on the theoretical foundations of these models and how they work.

Also we will try out some of these models and tools.

## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Jakob.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
