## Preparation

Please read the following texts:

* [Less Wrong, More Rite (II)](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/12/18/less-wrong-more-rite-ii/)
* [A Paradox of Ecclesiology](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/14/ecclesiology-for-atheists/)
* [There Are Rules Here](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/24/there-are-rules-here/)
* [Nerds Can Be Bees, Too](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/19/nerds-can-be-bees-too/)


## What will we do?

We will reflect on and discuss secular rituals. Do humans need rituals? Is it
possible to have non-religious rituals? Are there risks associated with it? To
direct our discussion please read the texts above since they will be the
framing. People who were unable to read the texts beforehand will read one of
them during the meetup and only then join the discussion.

Afterwards we will try to design hypothetical secular rituals in small groups
and then critique them for how useful, effective and potentially harmful they
are.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
