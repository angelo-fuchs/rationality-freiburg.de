## Preparation

Bring a **laptop** (preferable) or at least a smartphone to the meetup.

Make sure you have a **Google/Gmail account** because you'll need it to play on
[Backstabbr](https://www.backstabbr.com). Note that it is possible to create a
Google account with any other e-mail address, you don't need to create a Gmail
e-mail address. Follow this link: https://accounts.google.com/SignUpWithoutGmail .

If you REALLY don't want to create a Google account then register on
https://www.playdiplomacy.com/ but note that I will be able to provide less
support because I don't know the platform. You'll also have to find enough
other meetup participants who want to play there.

Watch the following two **game tutorials**. I will assume some people don't know
the rules so I will explain them, but it will be very useful if in every group
there are as many people as possible with a solid understanding of the rules.

* [Video: How to play on Backstabbr (12 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l53oL0ptt7k)
* [Video: Learn Diplomacy (22 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-sSWsBdbNI)

Optional:

* [Short rules](https://world-diplomacy-wiki.fandom.com/wiki/Diplomacy_Rules_(Short_version))
* [Detailed rules (PDF)](https://media.wizards.com/2015/downloads/ah/diplomacy_rules.pdf)
* [Video: Diplomacy: The Game of Knife (38 min)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oUaLEgzvMQs)

**Note "Winter":** All versions of Diplomacy involve two seasons of the
year Spring and Fall. The end-of-the-year phase where new units are built or
removed is sometimes called Winter (for example on Backstabbr) but many sources
just lump that in as a special step in the Fall season. Don't be confused, the
result is the same.


## What will we do?

I will give a presentation on the game "Diplomacy", its rules, historical
background and CICERO, an AI agent that was able to successfully master the
game, which is particularly impressive since the game requires negotiating
strategy and treaties with human players (as well as deceiving them) using
natural language.

We will then play the game in smaller groups (using an online platform for the
mechanics but negotiating in person) and finally we'll have a short discussion
on what insights we gained.

Players that know the game will be aware that it takes very long to play until
completion. Every subgroup will have the choice of continuing their game online
in the days following the meetup, or not.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
