## Preparation

To be defined.


## What will we do?

I will give a presentation on the game "Diplomacy", its rules, historical
background and CICERO, an AI agent that was able to successfully master the
game, which is particularly impressive since the game requires negotiating
strategy and treaties with human players (as well as deceiving them) using
natural language.

We will then play the game in smaller groups (using an online platform for the
mechanics but negotiating in person) and finally we'll have a short discussion
on what insights we gained.

Players that know the game will be aware that it takes very long to play until
completion. Every subgroup will have the choice of continuing their game online
in the days following the meetup, or not.


## Organization

You are worried you have nothing to contribute? No worries! Everyone is
welcome!

There always is a mix of German and English speakers and we configure the
discussion rounds so that everyone feels comfortable participating. The primary
language is English.

This meetup will be hosted by Omar.

There will be snacks and drinks.

We will go and get dinner after the meetup. Anyone who has time is welcome to
join.
