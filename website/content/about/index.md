## FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### What is Rationality?

The art of thinking in ways that result in accurate beliefs and good decisions.
Accurate beliefs means having mental models that correlate with reality and is
usually called _epistemic rationality_. Making good decisions means making
decisions that get you closer to your own personal goals and is usually called
_instrumental rationality_.

Having more accurate beliefs and making better decisions is what we **aspire**
to.

Rationality should not be confused with rationalism (the philosophical belief
that reason and intellectual deduction are the primary source of knowledge,
rather than sensory experience).

### Is Rationality the rejection of emotions or are human emotions bad?

No. Emotions and gut feelings are an integral part of the human experience and
in fact, vital for our survival. Having accurate beliefs (i.e. seeing the world
as it really is) also implies seeing humans as they really are. Emotions and
intuitions work very well in most situations, only in some cases they can
mislead us. Recognizing those cases and then improving the result of your
decisions is useful.

### What do you do?

We have [meetups]({{< ref "/events" >}}) every two weeks where we discuss
interesting topics and do exercises or play games that are fun and sometimes
teach us useful skills to better reach our personal goals. We also have a [book
club]({{< ref "/posts/book-club" >}}) and a [statistics study group]({{< ref
"/posts/statistics-study-group" >}}).

### Is this group affiliated with a political party or entity?

No.

### Is this group a cult/sect?

No. But remember that [every cause wants to be a
cult](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yEjaj7PWacno5EvWa/every-cause-wants-to-be-a-cult),
so we encourage you to always stay skeptical.
